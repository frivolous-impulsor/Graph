C++ implementation of Graph

Graphs are templated, meaning it accepts any data type as vertex

Location is 2D coordinate datatype, a sample data type for vertex in graph

Undirected Graph inherites directed graph.
Undirected Graph possesses Minimum Spanning Tree and Dijkstra's Shortest Path member function

Auxilary index priority queue ensure optimum update time efficiency as a priority queue

for use, reference directed and undirected graph header file
